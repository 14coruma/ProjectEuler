# Project Euler Solutions
[Project Euler](projecteuler.net) contains a collection of mathy problems. Solutions are to be coded up, then the results can be submitted on the site.
This repo contains a few of the problems/solutions that I have completed.
I am primarily doing this just for fun, as a way to do a little coding and enjoy learning a little math.

**Note:** Project Euler asks that solutions to problems after the first 100 are not posted online.
Since this is a public repo, I will be excluding problems 101 and onward.
